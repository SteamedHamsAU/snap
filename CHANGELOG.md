# Changelog

All notable changes to Snap will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.3.2-alpha] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- External Above preset left-aligned instead of centred when transitioning from mirror mode — display bounds are now read after the unmirror transaction commits ([#85])

## [0.3.1-alpha] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- False "No display connected" after applying mirror or extend configuration — macOS reconfiguration events with both `removeFlag` and `addFlag` are now correctly treated as no-ops instead of disconnects ([#83])

## [0.3.0-alpha] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- Display hardening: resilient display detection with UUID-based identification, retry logic, and graceful fallbacks ([#78])
- Debug details panel in Settings → Displays (Option-click the tab to toggle) ([#78])
- Comprehensive test suite: `DisplayConfigStore`, `DisplayConfigurator`, `DisplayMonitor` tests ([#78])
- Auto-dispatch appcast update to website repo on tagged release ([#77])
- CI environment gate (`website-deploy`) for website dispatch ([#77])

### Fixed

- Option-click debug toggle now scoped to tab-switch gesture only — no longer triggers on any Option-click in the window ([#78])
- Test host no longer launches full UI, preventing CI hangs ([#78])

## [0.2.1-alpha] — 2026-03-26
